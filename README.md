In the event of termination, the provisions of paragraph 5 shall continue for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of termination, and the provisions of paragraph 18 of this License shall survive.

You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this License and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Razer from your use of the MDK.

Any dispute relating to your use of the MDK shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in San Diego, California, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Razer’s IPR, Razer may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

This License and other legal notices published by Razer at www.osvr.com from time to time shall constitute the entire agreement between You and Razer concerning the MDK. If any of the provisions of this License shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of this License, which shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver, and Razer’s failure to assert any right under this License shall not constitute a waiver of such right. You agree that any cause of action arising out of or relating to the MDK must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, and otherwise is permanently barred. You may not assign or transfer this License, but Razer may assign this License without restriction.
